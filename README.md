# SQL_developer-task5
This project demonstrates essential SQL querying and table relationship concepts using sample CSV datasets (users.csv, posts.csv, and interactions.csv).
The focus is on learning  joining techniques.
Types of Joins Covered:

INNER JOIN → Returns only matching records from both tables.

LEFT JOIN → Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right.

RIGHT JOIN → Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left.

FULL JOIN → Returns all records where there is a match in either table.

SELF_JOIN → Learn how to join a table with itself to find relationships within the same dataset.

Outcome:
Master merging datasets for complex reporting and analysis.
